## Movie_recommendation System

# Creating a Recommender System to show personalized movie recommendations based on ratings given by a user and other users similar to them in order to improve user experience.

# Summary of Movie Recommendation System

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Movie Data:**
   - The **movies** dataset was loaded, and the **genres** column was split into individual genres for each movie.
   - Dummy variables for each genre were created, and the movies were grouped to represent genres in a binary format (1 for presence of the genre, 0 for absence).
   - The dataset was structured so that each movie had its corresponding genres in a format suitable for further analysis.

2. **Analyzing Genre Distribution:**
   - The unique genres in the dataset were extracted, and the most common genres were identified.
   - A bar plot was created to visualize the top 5 genres based on their frequency in the dataset.

3. **Processing Ratings Data:**
   - The **ratings** dataset, which contained combined user, movie, and rating information, was split into individual columns for user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings.
   - The unnecessary **timestamp** column was dropped, and the dataset was cleaned to focus only on user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings.

4. **Processing User Data:**
   - The **users** dataset was split into individual columns for user ID, gender, age, and other demographic information.
   - The gender column was encoded numerically (0 for male, 1 for female), and the age values were converted to integers.
   - The dataset was cleaned, with unnecessary columns removed.

5. **Merging Datasets:**
   - The **ratings**, **users**, and **movies** datasets were merged to form a comprehensive dataset that included user ratings for each movie, along with user demographics and movie genres.

6. **Top 5 Movies by Average Rating:**
   - The average rating for each movie was calculated, and the top 5 highest-rated movies were identified.
   - A horizontal bar chart was created to visualize the top 5 movies based on their average ratings.

7. **Top 5 Animation Movies:**
   - The dataset was filtered to include only movies categorized as "Animation."
   - The top 5 animation movies were identified based on their average ratings, and a horizontal bar chart was plotted to display these movies.

8. **User-Movie Matrix Creation:**
   - A user-movie matrix was created, where rows represented users, columns represented movies, and values represented the ratings each user gave to a specific movie.
   - Missing ratings were initially filled with zeros, and this matrix was prepared for further analysis.

9. **Collaborative Matrix Factorization:**
   - The matrix was decomposed using Collaborative Matrix Factorization (CMF) with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to predict missing ratings.
   - The predicted ratings were used to fill in the missing entries in the user-movie matrix.

10. **Item-Item Similarity Matrix:**
   - A similarity matrix was computed based on the Pearson correlation between movies, helping identify how similar one movie is to another based on user ratings.
   - This matrix was used for item-item recommendations.

11. **Item-Based Movie Recommendation System:**
   - A function was implemented to recommend the top 5 movies similar to a given movie based on the item-item similarity matrix.
   - This allowed for movie recommendations based on the similarity of movies.

12. **User-User Similarity Matrix:**
   - A cosine similarity matrix was created for users based on their movie rating patterns.
   - This matrix helped identify users who had similar preferences.

13. **User-Based Recommendation System:**
   - A user-based recommendation function was created, which recommended movies that similar users had seen but the target user had not yet watched.
   - This system provided personalized recommendations based on similar users' viewing history.

### Conclusion:
The project successfully implemented a movie recommendation system using both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering techniques. The recommendation models were based on the similarity of movies or usersâ€™ rating behaviors. By combining user ratings, demographic data, and movie genres, this system effectively suggested relevant movies to users, improving the personalization of movie recommendations.
